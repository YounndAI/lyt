  Manage pod-local vault aliases — bind a short handler-chosen name to a vault (alias → rid; survives rename + move), list the bindings, re-point one, or remove one. Trigger when the user runs /lyt-alias, or says "alias this vault as X", "give <vault> a short name", "what aliases do I have", "list my aliases", "rename my alias", "re-point alias X", "remove alias X", "drop the alias for X". Wraps `lyt alias <name> <target>` / `lyt alias --list` / `lyt alias --remove <name>` (all `--json`). Aliases are pod-local: synced across your own pod's machines, never to subscribers. Read-only on the target — works on a subscribed/read-only vault. Pairs with /lyt-pod and /lyt-search (which resolve `@alias` addresses).

# /lyt-alias

Manage **pod-local aliases** — a short, handler-chosen name that resolves to a vault. An alias binds a name to the vault's **`rid` (its UUIDv7 identity)**, not to its `{mesh}/{vault}` display name, so the alias keeps working after the vault is renamed or moved between meshes. Aliases are a convenience layer over the one addressing chokepoint every `lyt` verb resolves through (`{mesh}/{vault}` → bare leaf → alias → origin coordinate).

This skill is pure prose around three existing CLI forms of one verb — it adds no new command and changes no `lyt-vault` code:

- `lyt alias <name> <target>` — **set / re-point** (bind, or rebind, `name` → the vault `target` resolves to)
- `lyt alias --list` (or bare `lyt alias`) — **list** every pod-local alias
- `lyt alias --remove <name>` — **remove** an alias

All three accept `--json` for a machine-readable emission. The CLI does the resolution and validation; this skill resolves the user's intent into the right form, runs it (preferring `--json`), and formats the result for the handler.

**Pod-local, never federated.** Aliases live in your local registry and sync across **your own pod's** machines — they are filtered out of the publish surface, so a subscriber never sees them. They are per-pod, individual naming. (Mechanically each set/remove appends a convergent `@ALIAS` record to this writer's own append-only shard, HLC-stamped, so re-point and remove converge correctly across your machines — but that is invisible at the skill surface.)

## When to invoke

When the user runs `/lyt-alias [...]`, or says something like:

- "alias `<vault>` as `<name>`" / "give `<mesh>/<vault>` the short name `<name>`" — _set_
- "what aliases do I have" / "list my aliases" / "show my pod-local names" — _list_
- "re-point `<name>` to `<other-vault>`" / "make `<name>` point at `<vault>` instead" — _re-point (same as set)_
- "remove the alias `<name>`" / "drop my `<name>` alias" / "unbind `<name>`" — _remove_

If the user wants to browse what vaults exist (to pick a target), prefer `/lyt-pod`. If they want to search content, prefer `/lyt-search`. This skill only manages the name→vault bindings.

Recommend an alias when qualified names collide, are repeatedly cumbersome, or the Handler asks for one. Never create an alias automatically. Always keep the canonical qualified name and vault RID visible in the result.

## Phase 1 — Classify the intent

Pick the form from the user's wording:

1. **Set / re-point** — a `name` AND a `target` are present ("alias `ro` to `company/company-ro`"). Re-pointing is the same verb: running `lyt alias <name> <newtarget>` again supersedes the prior binding (the fold is a name-keyed register — no separate "rename" verb, no need to remove first).
2. **List** — no name given, or the user asks to see bindings.
3. **Remove** — the user wants a binding gone.

If the user names a target ambiguously, resolve it the way the CLI will (see Phase 2) rather than guessing.

## Phase 2 — Validate the inputs you control

The CLI enforces these and will error cleanly, but check first so you can ask instead of emitting a failed command:

- **Alias `name`** must be non-empty, contain **no `/`** (slash is reserved for `{mesh}/{vault}`), **no whitespace**, and **must not start with `@`**. The `@` is the chat-surface sigil — an address like `@ro` resolves to the alias `ro`; aliases are stored **raw** (sigil-free), so a leading `@` is rejected at the write boundary. If the user says "alias it as `@ro`", store `ro` and explain `@ro` is how they'll _reference_ it.
- **`target`** (for set) may be a `{mesh}/{vault}` qualified address, a **bare leaf** (unique vault name across meshes), or **another alias**. It is resolved through the addressing chokepoint; if it resolves to nothing the CLI raises `alias-target-not-found` (exit 2). Surface that to the user with `lyt vault list` as the next step — don't retry blindly.

## Phase 3 — Run the verb

Prefer `--json` so you parse a typed result rather than scraping prose.

```bash
# set / re-point
lyt alias <name> <target> --json        # → { alias, vaultRidHex, targetDisplayName }

# list
lyt alias --list --json                  # → { aliases: [{ alias, vaultRidHex, targetDisplayName }] }

# remove
lyt alias --remove <name> --json         # → { removed: <bool>, alias }
```

## Phase 4 — Present the result

- **Set / re-point:** confirm the binding, e.g. _"Aliased `ro` → `company/company-ro` (`vault:0a1b…`). Reference it anywhere as `@ro` or `ro`."_ If it was a re-point, say what it now points at.
- **List:** render one line per alias — `name → targetDisplayName (vault:<ridHex>)`. If `targetDisplayName` is **`(dangling — target removed)`**, flag it: the target vault is gone but the binding lingers — offer `lyt alias --remove <name>`. If there are none, say so and show the set form.
- **Remove:** confirm removal. If `removed` is `false` (no such alias), tell the user plainly — don't claim success.

## Notes on lifecycle

- **Aliases self-clean on vault teardown.** When a vault is removed via `lyt vault delete` / `lyt vault forget`, every pod-local alias pointing at it is **warned about and dropped** as part of that flow — you don't need to pre-remove aliases before deleting a vault. (`lyt vault disconnect` does _not_ drop aliases; it only flips a status flag.)
- **Re-point and remove converge across your pod's machines** by HLC-LWW — the newest set/remove wins per name. After a cross-machine change, a reconstitution (`lyt reindex` / the next sync-driven cache rebuild) refreshes the derived cache; the ledger is the source of truth.

## Rules

- **Never invent a target.** If the user's target doesn't resolve, surface the CLI's `alias-target-not-found` error and point them at `lyt vault list` — do not silently pick a different vault.
- **Strip the `@` sigil before storing.** Store `ro`, never `@ro`. Explain the `@` is for referencing.
- **Don't gate on vault writability.** Aliases are your own pod-local registry; you can alias a read-only or subscribed vault. `requires_writable_vault` is false by design.
- **Prefer `--json`** and report the typed fields; don't paraphrase a binding you didn't read back.
- **Never auto-create an alias.** The Handler chooses the short name; creation receipts may only recommend this skill.
- **Removal/re-point is not destructive to the vault** — it only changes a local name binding. No handler-confirmation gate is required for alias set/list/remove (unlike `vault delete`/`forget`).

## Companion skills

- `/lyt-pod` — enumerate the vaults you might alias (and pick a target).
- `/lyt-search` — query across the pod; resolves `@alias` addresses.
- `/lyt-sync` — propagate alias changes across your pod's machines.
